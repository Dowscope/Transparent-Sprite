2021-Mar-20 - I'm having troubles getting the debug to work using GCC.  I am not sure how to switch the console off when the debug is not being used.

### Wayland Issue - Mar 16 2021
I'm using Arch Linux with Wayland.  The window would not show for me and would cause me great grief as to why this was happening.  Apparently because of Wayland, a window does not appear till something is drawn to it.  I guess we will see if this is still the case.
